# Strings are strings of characters, which we can create by delimiting those characters with single or double quotes, like
# for example "blue" or 'blue', being able to use singles or doubles inside the other like "the sky is 'blue'" or 'the sky is "blue"'

# example:

name = 'Abra√£o Carvalho'

puts name
